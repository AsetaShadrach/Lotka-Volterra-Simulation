## Lotka Volterra Prey Predator Simulation
- Simulates the population changes in a predator-prey ecosystem. 
- By altering the rates of death/birth we can observe what happens in different scenarios

## Bouncing Ball Simulation
- Simple - simulatiate the ball movement if it is just dropped from certain heights
- Verical aspects - simulates the ball if thrown up or down at certain angles
- 3D - imporoves on vertical aspects by depicting what happens , but in a 3 dimensional space <br>
#### _This bouncing ball simulations ignore any affect from friction/air resistance_
